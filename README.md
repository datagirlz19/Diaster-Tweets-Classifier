# Diaster-Tweets-Classifier
Twitter can be as both a resource for finding urgent information and as a tool for communicating useless information about sales and petty gossip. 

# Classifying Tweets about Natural Diasasters 

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to use NLP to predict whether a tweet is reporting on a natural disaster/crisis or not. Twitter can be both a resource for finding urgent information such as reporting Natural Disasters (real-time) and asking for help during times of crisis. Hashtags can be useful tools for sifting through the nonsense, but they can also be misused for sales and gossip. This project aims to use Natural Language Processing to determine which messages posted on Twitter can be classified as Natural Disasters or spam.
